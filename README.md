# Customer--Segmentation
CLuster our customers

# Problem Statement
In ecommerce companies like online retails, customer segmentation is necessary in order to understand customers behaviors. It leverages aqcuired customer data like the one we have in our case, transactions data in order to divide customers into groups.
Our goal in this Notebook is to cluster our customers to get insights in:
* Increasing revenue (Knowing customers who present most of our revenue)
* Increasing customer retention
* Discovering Trends and patterns
* Defining customers at risk
* We will do RFM Analysis as a first step and then combine RFM with predictive algorithms (k-means).
** RFM Analysis answers these questions:** 
* Who are our best customers?
* Who has the potential to be converted in more profitable customers?
* Which customers we must retain?
* Which group of customers is most likely to respond to our current campaign?

# RFM analysis
* RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a proven marketing model for behaviour based customer segmentation.
* It groups customers based on their transaction history in other termsâ€“ how recently (R), how often (F) and how much (M) did they buy.
* RFM helps divide customers into various categories or in better terms into clusters to identify customers who are more likely to respond to a promotion or not... so we try to predict the next purchases of the customers

This project focus on customer analysis and segmentation. Which help to generate specific marketing strategies targeting different groups. RFM Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and K-means Clusters were conducted on a UK-based online retail transaction dataset with 1,067,371 rows of records hosted on themMachine Learning Repository.

Meaningful Finding
Special group
Group of 2009 Dec, have a high retention rate, keep remaining around 20 - 40 %
Group of 2010 Dec, have a relatively low retention rate that keeping under 12 % afterward
Special period
All groups have a significant increase in retention rate in Oct, Nov 2010, and Nov 2011, we believe it may be related to the Black Friday events.
Special trend
A notable increase in the retention of the group after Jan 2011 can be observed from the cohort analysis.
